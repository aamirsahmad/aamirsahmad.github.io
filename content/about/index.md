I'm a passionate technophile with a deep love for open source and an insatiable curiosity for all things tech. My interests span from the intricacies of AI and compilers to the vast realms of infrastructure and quantum physics. I enjoy pondering the big questions—like the origin of life, consciousness, and our perception of reality.

Music is a significant part of my life, and I enjoy a wide variety of genres, from techno and house to classical, hip-hop, and even Punjabi, Arab, and Latin beats. I'm also learning to play the piano, a new hobby that blends my love for music with my desire to constantly learn.

When I'm not immersed in code—having written in languages like Python, Java, Ruby, Go, Clojure, OCaml, Scala, TypeScript, JavaScript, Prolog, Lisp, and PHP—you'll likely find me outdoors, whether it's camping, hiking, or biking on my Specialized Sirrus. Traveling is another passion, with recent trips to Taiwan, Thailand, Dubai, and various major cities in the US and Canada.

My interests extend to geopolitics, history, and photography. I started with a Nikon D5100 but now rely on my iPhone 15 Pro for capturing stunning landscapes, especially while experimenting with my DJI drone. I'm also an avid TV show enthusiast, with favorites like _Arrested Development_, _The Office_, _Better Call Saul_, and _The Sopranos_. And when time permits, I enjoy diving into a good book.
